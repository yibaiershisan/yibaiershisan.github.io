                <p><b>Introduction:</b>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandong cuisine is one of the four
                    traditional Chinese cuisines (and also one of the eight major cuisines) with its own style (compared to
                    influential cuisines such as Huaiyang, Sichuan, and Guangdong). It is the first of the eight major cuisines
                    in China, representing northern cuisine and the foundation of Chinese home cooked cuisine. It is the oldest,
                    most skillful, and most skilled cuisine, as well as a representative of culinary culture in the Yellow River
                    Basin.

                <span>简介：
                    鲁菜，是中国传统四大菜系（也是八大菜系）中的自发型菜系（相对于淮扬、川、粤等影响型菜系而言）
                    [1]，中国八大菜系之首，是北方菜的代表，也是中国家常菜的基础，是历史最悠久、技法最丰富、最见功力的菜系，黄河流域烹饪文化的代表。 </span>

                <p><b>Development history:</b>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandong is located in the lower reaches of
                    the Yellow River, with a mild climate. There are many diverse landforms in the province, such as rivers,
                    lakes, hills, plains, and the sea, which has created an extremely rich and balanced variety of food
                    materials for Shandong cuisine: the frequency of entering each category of Shandong cuisine, such as fruits
                    and vegetables, livestock, seafood, freshwater river food, mountain mushrooms, and dried treasures, is
                    between 15% and 18% (the data comes from the research of Mr. Zhou Xiaoyan, a famous chef of Huaiyang Cuisine
                    and a professor of Yangzhou University. The frequency of entering a category of freshwater products of
                    Huaiyang cuisine accounts for 40%, and the frequency of entering a category of Sichuan cuisine, livestock
                    accounts for 50%). The cooking techniques that are most suitable for each type of ingredient are different,
                    and the rich variety of ingredients directly stimulates the rich and diverse cooking techniques of Shandong
                    cuisine. The unique material conditions of Shandong, combined with the Confucian school's pursuit of "never
                    tire of the essence of food and never tire of the details of food" for more than two thousand years, have
                    finally become the grand view of Shandong cuisine.

                <span>发展历史：
                    山东位于黄河下游，气候温和，省内汇集有大河、大湖、丘陵、平原、大海等多样性的地貌，造就了鲁菜的食材选料品种异常丰富与均衡：鲁菜的果蔬、禽畜、海鲜、淡水河鲜、山菌、干制珍品等每个类别的入菜频率都在15%～18%之间（数据来源于淮扬菜名厨兼扬州大学教授周晓燕先生的研究，淮扬菜淡水产品一个类别入菜频率占40%，川菜禽畜一个类别的入菜频率占50%）。最适合每一种的食材的烹饪技法各不相同，丰富的食材品种直接激发了鲁菜烹饪技法的丰富多样。山东大地得天独厚的物质条件，加上两千多年来浸润着儒家学派“食不厌精、脍不厌细”的精神追求，终成鲁菜系的洋洋大观。</span>

            <div class="text-container">
                <p><b>Flavor characteristics:</b>
                    <br>Mainly salty and fresh
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandong cuisine emphasizes the quality of
                    raw materials, using salt to enhance freshness, soup to enhance freshness, and seasoning to emphasize the
                    purity of saltiness and freshness, highlighting the original flavor. Scallions are a specialty of Shandong,
                    and most dishes require the use of scallions, ginger, and garlic to enhance aroma and flavor. Methods such
                    as stir frying, frying, frying, grilling, and roasting all require the use of scallions. Especially for
                    dishes with scallion burning, it is best to have a strong onion aroma, such as braised sea cucumber with
                    scallions or braised tendon with scallions; Feeding fillings, stir frying, and cold dishes all require
                    scallions, ginger, and garlic. Seafood is abundant and of good quality, with a light fishy taste. Fresh
                    people pay attention to the original taste. Shrimp, crab, shellfish, and clams are often paired with ginger
                    vinegar; High grade ingredients such as bird's nest, shark's fin, sea cucumber, dried abalone, fish skin,
                    and fish bones are of good quality and low taste, so it is necessary to use high broth to enhance freshness.
                </p>
                <span>风味特色：
                    <br> 咸鲜为主
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;鲁菜讲究原料质地优良，以盐提鲜，以汤壮鲜，调味讲求咸鲜纯正，突出本味。大葱为山东特产，多数菜肴要要用葱姜蒜来增香提味，炒、熘、爆、扒、烧等方法都要用葱，尤其是葱烧类的菜肴，更是以拥有浓郁的葱香为佳，如葱烧海参、葱烧蹄筋；喂馅、爆锅、凉拌都少不了葱姜蒜。海鲜类量多质优，异腥味较轻，鲜活者讲究原汁原味，虾、蟹、贝、蛤，多用姜醋佐食；燕窝、鱼翅、海参、干鲍、鱼皮、鱼骨等高档原料，质优味寡，必用高汤提鲜。</span>
            </div>
            <div class="text-container">
                <p>Fire characteristics
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outstanding cooking methods of Shandong
                    cuisine include exploding, scraping, and pulling silk, especially the exploding and pulling silk, which are
                    well-known by the world. Explosion can be divided into oil explosion, soy sauce explosion, coriander
                    explosion, scallion explosion, soup explosion, hot explosion, etc. "The way of cooking is like taking
                    treasure from fire. If it is not cooked well, it will be born; if it is slightly over, it will be old,
                    competing for it in an instant, and losing it in an instant.". The explosive technique fully reflects the
                    skill of Shandong cuisine in using fire. Therefore, people call it "food in China, fire in Shandong".
                </p>
                <span>火候特点
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;鲁菜的突出烹调方法为爆、扒、
                    拔丝，尤其是爆、拔丝为世人所称道。爆，分为油爆、酱爆、芫爆、葱爆、汤爆、火爆等，“烹饪之道，如火中取宝。不及则生，稍过则老，争之于俄顷，失之于须臾”。爆的技法充分体现了鲁菜在用火上的功夫。因此，世人称之为“食在中国，火在山东”。</span>

            <div class="text-container">
                <p>Skilled in making soup
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu cuisine uses soup as the source of all
                    kinds of freshness, emphasizing the modulation of "clear soup" and "milk soup", with clear turbidity and
                    freshness. The method of making clear soup has been recorded as early as in "Qi Min Yao Shu". There are a
                    variety of dishes made with "clear soup" and "milk soup", including famous dishes such as "clear soup family
                    photo", "clear soup white fungus", "clear soup bird's nest", "boiled lotus yellow tube", "milk soup Pucai",
                    "milk soup eight treasure cloth bag chicken", "soup explosion double crispy", etc., which are often listed
                    as delicacies in high-end banquets.
                </p>
                <span>精于制汤
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;鲁菜以汤为百鲜之源，讲究“清汤”、“奶汤”的调制，清浊分明，取其清鲜。清汤的制法，早在《齐民要术》中已有记载。用“清汤”和“奶汤”制作的菜品繁多，名菜就有“清汤全家福”、‘’清汤银耳“、‘’清汤燕窝“、氽芙蓉黄管”、“奶汤蒲菜”、“奶汤八宝布袋鸡”、“汤爆双脆”等，多被列为高档宴席的珍馔美味。</span>
            </div>
            <div class="text-container">
                <p>Skilled in cooking seafood
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cooking of sea delicacies and small
                    seafood is unparalleled. Shandong's seafood, whether it's ginseng, wings, swallows, shellfish, scales, scale
                    insects, shrimp, or crabs, can all become exquisite and delicious dishes cooked with the ingenuity of local
                    chefs.
                </p>
                <span>善烹海味
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;对海珍品和小海味的烹制堪称一绝。山东的海产品，不论参、翅、燕、贝，还是鳞、蚧、虾、蟹，经当地厨师的妙手烹制，都可成为精鲜味美之佳肴。</span>
            </div>
            <div class="text-container">
                <p>Pay attention to etiquette
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandong has a simple folk style, hospitable
                    and generous hospitality. In terms of food, it is abundant and affordable with large plates and bowls,
                    emphasizing quality. Influenced by Confucius' concept of ritual food, it emphasizes on appearance and
                    dietary etiquette. Regular banquets include so-called "perfect banquets", such as "large banquets", "shark
                    fin banquets", "shark fin banquets", "shark fin abalone banquets", "sea cucumber banquets", "swallow wing
                    banquets", and "four four four banquets", all of which can reflect the elegant and atmospheric side of
                    Shandong cuisine.
                </p>
                <span>注重礼仪
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;山东民风朴实，待客豪爽，在饮食上大盘大碗丰盛实惠，注重质量，受孔子礼食思想的影响，讲究排场和饮食礼仪。正规筵席有所谓的“十全十美席”，“大件席”、“鱼翅席”、“翅鲍席”、“海参席”、“燕翅席”、“四四席”等，都能体现出鲁菜典雅大气的一面。</span>
